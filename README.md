# ShoppingCartDemo

This project is built using ASP.NET Web API, Angular 2 and Bootstrap 3
for the front-end framework. I choosed Angular since it was the easiest to 
get started with and provides great SPA functionality. 

I did not put any gunpowder on the aesthetics of the website and focused on the backend code.

The application is entirely self-hosted using Microsoft OWIN
so all you have to do is compile it and press F5. 

For deploying it, you can either host it as a .exe or compile it as a DLL
and use it within IIS.
