    # Shopping Cart Demo made for ![Serenata Flowers](http://images.serenataassets.com/image/upload/v1/serenatalogo-site.png)

## Author
This project was coded by Johan Nordstrom to gauge programming capabilities. 

## Technologies 
This project is built using ASP.NET Web API, Angular 2 and Bootstrap 3
    for the front-end framework. I choosed Angular since it was the easiest to 
get started with and provides great SPA functionality. 

## Summary
I did not put any gunpowder on the aesthetics of the website and focused on the backend code.

## Project Goals
These are some of the things id like to have implemented. 
* Seperate Web API into seperate assembly and keep frontend in express project
that only serves an Index.html with templates (for example in mustache).
* Seperate all cart logic into a seperate controller, angular does not have a good solution for sharing functions between 
controllers though.
